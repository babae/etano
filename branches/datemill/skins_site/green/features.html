<a name="requirements"></a><h3><a class="totop" href="#pagetop" title="Back to top">top</a>Script requirements</h3>
<ul class="features">
	<li>
		<strong>PHP 4.4.0+</strong>
		Although Etano may run on older versions of PHP we consider this to be a security risk.<br />
		PHP 4.4.0 was released on 11-Jul-2005. If your host hasn't been able to update in such a long time you should move to another host.<br />
		The script should work with php configured as a fast-cgi or cgi module but the Apache module is prefered.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Mysql Support</strong>
		Etano needs a MySql database to store all members, friends, messages, blogs, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>PHP mail() support</strong>
		Your host must allow the use of the mail() function to send emails to your members. Note that your host must not limit the number of emails you can send per hour or day, otherwise some emails might not reach their destination. Please check with your host.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>PHP GD2 graphic library with FreeType support</strong>
		Etano needs the GD2 library to create thumbnails of photos and for other photo manipulation operations.<br />
		If your server does not support the FreeType library, Etano will still work but you will not be able to use the captcha and photo watermark features.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Cron Jobs</strong>
		Your host must allow you to run a cron job every 5 minutes. Note that some hosts don't allow cron jobs at all, others don't allow them so often. Check with your host.<br />
		If they don't allow you to run cron jobs please <a href="contact.php" title="Contact Us">contact us</a> to discuss the possibility of having your cron job run remotely.
	</li>
</ul>
