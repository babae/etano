<h2>Backup Database</h2>

<p>Using this option you can backup your database. The database holds all member info, their messages, preferences, your site settings,
payment information, etc.</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ol id="backup_note">
	<li>The database does NOT contain the member photos! If you want to back them up too you need to download the 'media' folder by ftp.</li>
	<li>In some situations the download could get pretty big (more than 10Mb). This means that it will take a few minutes to download it all.</li>
	<li>This option backs up only the Etano database this site is using. If you have other databases (for forums, chats, other sites) you must back them up using their respective backup options.</li>
</ol>
